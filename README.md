# Antethesizer

## What

- Antethesizer is an attempt at allowing people to quickly create procedurally-generated music & musical ideas.
- The idea for now is to iterate quickly and smoothly in order to spark something, not necessarily to create a polished finished project immediately
- In the long term I will be looking to improve the procedural generation to the point that most long sections are immediately usable assets for games

## How

- To quickly generate music, click the red `+` sign in the top left, then select a size of passage (the size decreases from left to right)
- To change options, click the OPTIONS menu in the top right

## Launch

In the project directory, run `yarn start`
