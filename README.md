# Antethesizer

- Antethesizer is an attempt at allowing people to quickly create procedurally-generated music & musical ideas.
- The idea for now is to iterate quickly and smoothly in order to spark something, not necessarily to create a polished finished project immediately
- In the long term I will be looking to improve the procedural generation to the point that most long sections are immediately usable assets for games

### `yarn start`
